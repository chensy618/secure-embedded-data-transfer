\begin{abstract}
    In this project, we present creation of an
    embedded network system using the popular ESP32 platform. The system serves
    the purpose of recording audio samples and facilitating their remote
    transmission over the Internet. We go into the design and implementation
    of the sytem while simultaneously putting attention
    on pivotal security considerations that touch multiple
    layers of the architecture. We offer an examination of
    the developmental journey, drawing attention to notable experiences and
    insights gleaned during deployment and make proposals for their improvement.

\section{Introduction}

This report is structured as follows: in \cref{sec:background}, 
we give a short overview of our project's goals while providing references to similar works. 
In \cref{sec:system_design}, we go into the design of the system, giving a high-level overview of the architecture and 
the components used. Then, in \cref{sec:system_implementation}, we go over the final implementation and comment on it's performance, 
while also highligthing some of the security considerations we took into account. Finally, in \cref{sec:discussion_and_conclusions},
we discuss the results of our work and propose some ideas for future work.

\section{Project Objectives} % Project Objectives 
\label{sec:background}

The goal of this project is to create a networked embedded system that can record audio samples and transmit them over the Internet.
The use case for something like could be a remote monitoring system, where the device is placed in a remote location and 
the user can listen to an audio feed from their device. Applications such as baby monitors or home security systems come to mind.
In both of these cases, the confidentiality of the audio feed is very important and
attacks on such systems have been demonstrated in the past \cite{BabyMonitorHack, VideoSurvAttacks}.

\section{System Design}
\label{sec:system_design}

\subsection{Architecture}
\subsection{Hardware Setup}
The system consists of two ESP32\cite{ESP32_Manual} microcontrollers.
\subsection{Software and Firmware}
\subsection{Communcation}

\section{System Implementation}
\label{sec:system_implementation}
\subsection{Testing and Results}
\label{subsec:testing_and_results}
\subsection{Security Analysis}
\label{subsec:security_analysis}

\subsubsection{Threat Model}

We assume a strong software adversary that has physical acess to the device.
That means, the a persistent attacker might be able to extract the firmware from the device and
analyze it. Such analysis can result in cryptographic keys and certificates being extracted from the device
\footnote{In \cref{appendix:reverse_engineering} we provide a tutorial-like section where we act as an attacker and attempt to reverse engineer the firmware of an ESP32 device.}, 
to the proprietary program logic of the device being reverse engineered.
In addition, the device might be placed in an untrusted environment, where the communication as well 
as other networking infrastructure might tampered with.
An adversary might be able to \say{listen} to the communication between the two devices,
as they might be inside the same network.
Thus, the adversary might be able to perform a wide range of network attacks such 
as a DNS Cache Poisoning attack \cite{Dissanayake_2018}, the adversary might have acess to the local router 
settings, making a Domain Hijacking and Redirection attack \cite{DnsHijacking} trivial. In both of these attacks, 
the data transferred from the recording device to the server might be redirected to a malicious server, 
where the data might be stored and analyzed.

\appendix{Reverse Engineering ESP32 Firmware}
\label{appendix:reverse_engineering}

As proof of the necessity for taking precautions when shipping an embedded device, 
we provide a tutorial-like section where we act as an attacker and attempt to reverse engineer the firmware of an ESP32
device in order to extract sensitive information.
