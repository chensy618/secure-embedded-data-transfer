\begin{abstract}
    In this project, we present creation of an
    embedded network system using the popular ESP32 platform. The system serves
    the purpose of recording audio samples and facilitating their remote
    transmission over the Internet. We go into the design and implementation
    of the sytem while simultaneously putting attention
    on pivotal security considerations that touch multiple
    layers of the architecture. We offer an examination of
    the developmental journey, drawing attention to notable experiences and
    insights gleaned during deployment and make proposals for their improvement.

\section{Introduction}

This report is structured as follows: in \cref{sec:background}, 
we give a short overview of our project's goals while providing references to similar works. 
In \cref{sec:system_design}, we go into the design of the system, giving a high-level overview of the architecture and 
the components used. Then, in \cref{sec:system_implementation}, we go over the final implementation and comment on it's performance, 
while also highligthing some of the security considerations we took into account. Finally, in \cref{sec:discussion_and_conclusions},
we discuss the results of our work and propose some ideas for future work.

\section{Reverse Engineering ESP32 Firmware}

As proof of the necessity for taking precautions when shipping an embedded device, 
we provide a tutorial-like section where we act as an attacker and attempt to reverse engineer the firmware of an ESP32
device in order to extract sensitive information.
