ABSTRACT = {Video surveillance systems are widely deployed with large systems for use in strategic places such as home security, public transportation, banks, ATM centers, city centers, airports, and public roads, and play a vital role in protecting critical infrastructures. As various attacks are possible in these systems, identifying attacks and considering suitable security measures are essential. In this paper, we present a detailed review of existing and possible threats in video surveillance, CCTV, and IP-camera systems. This provides insight for the better identification of the security risks associated with the design and deployment of these systems and promotes further research in this emerging field. We also present countermeasures to prevent and protect the surveillance systems from various security attacks.},
